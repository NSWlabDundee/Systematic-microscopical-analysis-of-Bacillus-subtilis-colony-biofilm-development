# Biofilm_morphology_analysis
The purpose of this Matlab and R code is to analyse and visualise reflected light macro-scale and fluorescence confocal images of bacterial biofilms at various positions across a wide timeframe during conoly biofilm development.

This code requires OMERO.matlab [1] to be installed and OMERO.mtools [2] to be in your Matlab path. Connecting to an OMERO server can be done following the instructions on the OMERO MATLAB language bindings page [3]. A session object with ```global``` scope is necessary for these functions to operate.
